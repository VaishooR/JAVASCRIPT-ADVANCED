Using object constructor, multiple objects are created.
But properties can not be added to the object constructor directly. Properties can be added only to the individual objects seperatley.
So adding a property to one object, doesnot affect the other objects created using object constructor.
The property gets added to only one object that we have mentioned.


Ex:

function Person(first,last,age,eye){
  this.fname=first,
  this.lname=last,
  this.myAge=age,
  this.eyecolor=eye
}
const myFather=new Person('John','Doe',50,'blue');
const myMother=new Person('Sally','Rally',44,'green');
console.log(myMother);
console.log(myFather);

myFather.nationality='America';         <-------------- nationality property is being added only to the myFather object.
console.log(myFather);
console.log(myMother);


Output:

[object Object] {
  eyecolor: "blue",
  fname: "John",
  lname: "Doe",
  myAge: 50,
  nationality: "America"                 <-------------- nationality property has been added only to the myFather object. 
}
[object Object] {
  eyecolor: "green",
  fname: "Sally",
  lname: "Rally",
  myAge: 44                              <-------------- Not to the myMother object.
}
