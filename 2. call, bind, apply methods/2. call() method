Ex:

const person={
  fullname:function(city,country){
    return this.fname+'-'+this.lname+','+city+','+country
  }
}

const person1={
  fname:"John",
  lname:"Doe"
}

console.log(person.fullname.call(person1,'Chennai','India'))





Explanation:

Here person and person1 are two objects.
Now person1 object wants to access 'fullname' method from person object.
To access a method from another object, we use the call() method.
We can add or call only one object at a time.
So when call() method is used, this.fname refers to the object containing fname and lname.
